PROJECT NAME:
  TCO_Vendor_API

RELEASE DATE:
	2010/04/24

VERSION: 1.0 beta
  This PHP class file is being released as a beta to allow for
  other developers to provide bug reports, feature requests or
  comments with regard to this release.

  If no major issue have been filed within 90 days of the release
  date of this class, I will upgrade the version to 1.0 stable.

REQUIREMENTS:
  PHP 5.x w/ cURL installed as part of the PHP installation.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
  Developed for use in PHP 5.x environments, this PHP class was
  created to allow developers to access the API calls as released
  by 2Checkout.com late 2009.

  The 2Checkout Vendor API documentation can be seen at this link;
  http://www.2checkout.com/documentation/api/

  Each call has a very specific set of parameters and requirements
  depending on the method being called.

  Any class method that requires parameters will take its parameters
  in the form of an associative array. For instance,

  $params = array( 'sale_id' => '1234567890', 'invoice_id' => '2134567890' );
  $api->detail_sale( $params );

  This class does not pre-validate your input because the API handles
  reporting errors back for invalid parameters and such.

  This class was developed to simplify the curl apparatus that is
  used to make the remote calls to 2Checkout.


EXAMPLE USAGE:
  Use of this class is quite simple as demonstrated below.

  <?php
  define('API_USER', 'your_2co_username');
	define('API_PASS', 'your_2co_api_password');
	$format = 'json';

	$api = new TCO_Vender_API(API_USER, API_PASS);
	$api->set_format($format);
	print $api->detail_contact_info();
  ?>

  Successful response should look something like this;

  {
   "response_code" : "OK",
   "response_message" : "contact info retrieved",
   "vendor_contact_info" : {
      "customer_service_email" : "test@example.com",
      "customer_service_phone" : "123-456-7890",
      "customer_service_phone_ext" : "0",
      "mailing_address_1" : "1234 5th Street",
      "mailing_address_2" : "",
      "mailing_address_id" : "1112223334",
      "mailing_city" : "Columbus",
      "mailing_country_code" : "USA",
      "mailing_postal_code" : "43202",
      "mailing_state" : "Ohio",
      "office_email" : "office@example.com",
      "office_phone" : "222-333-4444",
      "office_phone_ext" : "0",
      "physical_address_1" : "2345 Office Ave.",
      "physical_address_2" : "",
      "physical_address_id" : "4445556666",
      "physical_city" : "Columbus",
      "physical_country_code" : "USA",
      "physical_postal_code" : "43202",
      "physical_state" : "Ohio",
      "vendor_id" : "1234567"
   }
	}
